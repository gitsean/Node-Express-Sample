# Mapping two objects

A node js project that merges two objects then compares them.

## About

This project takes two objects and merges them.

A nice way to improve this project would be to have the function that merges the object along side a separate test that validates that the object had been created correctly.

## Run the Project

Go to the directory in your command line and `make`.
